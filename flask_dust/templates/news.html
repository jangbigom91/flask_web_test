								<p>
									<strong>Busan City,</strong> 
									In the future, it will be able to check the fine dust situation in the neighborhood in real time.

									The Busan Institute of Health and Environment announced on the 29th that it will launch a "real-time fine dust information by neighborhood" service in July to help citizens check air quality information by neighborhood and prepare for high concentrations of air pollution.

									Busan is the first among local governments across the country to provide real-time fine dust services.

								<p>
									The fine dust data provided by Naver's weather used some 200 national network meters across the country, but added super-large air quality data collected by 2,200 KT meters across the country.
									KT's newly added fine dust meter is installed near facilities for the vulnerable to fine dust, such as base stations at breathing heights and schools and hospitals across the country with a large floating population, to measure the air quality felt by actual users.
